# Policy Evaluation Protocol

## Active improvement goal

- The current long-running improvement goal ends when the user's current
  100,000-token allocation resets. It does not end merely because the calendar
  month changes.
- At reset, finish the active verification/deployment checkpoint, record the
  remaining risks, and close the goal. Do not start speculative work just to
  consume tokens.
- Every service-changing iteration follows this sequence:
  inspect evidence, document the decision, test, back up mutable production
  data, commit, push, restart, send a Telegram report, and recheck health.

## Market separation

- Domestic and overseas policies are independently owned and versioned.
- Shared policy values are an initial baseline only. A result from one market
  is not evidence for changing the other market.
- Domestic performance is joined to the final KOSPI session regime.
- Overseas performance is joined to the final NASDAQ Composite session regime.
- Provisional benchmark rows are stored for monitoring but excluded from policy
  evaluation until the market close is final.

## Required evidence

Policy changes should use all of the following:

1. Prior order-submission performance, with broker fills checked separately.
2. Net performance after recorded costs, or a clearly labeled cost estimate.
3. The session's trend, volume activity, and volatility regime.
4. Multiple independent trading days, not repeated orders from one episode.
5. General market-microstructure and risk principles relevant to the decision.
6. A falsification criterion and a scheduled outcome review.

A market-regime/strategy bucket is exploratory until it has at least five
eligible exits across three distinct final sessions. Passing this minimum does
not force a change; it only permits evaluation. Higher-risk changes require a
larger sample.

## Frequency decisions

- Low order frequency is not itself a defect.
- Loosen entry gates only when blocked candidates show positive forward net
  expectancy after realistic costs and the result persists across regimes.
- Reject a frequency increase when the apparent gross edge is below costs,
  comes from one market day, or is concentrated in a hostile regime.
- Report frequency by market and only during sessions orderable by the active
  broker profile. Label it as order-submission frequency until fill
  reconciliation exists.

## Reasoning value audit

`policy_evaluation_log` records the hypothesis, evidence, alternatives,
financial principles, confidence, falsification test, and later outcome.

High-cost reasoning is never marked superior by assertion. Its
`comparative_value_status` starts as `unverified` and may change only after a
measurable comparison:

- `confirmed`: it found a material issue or avoided a policy error that the
  declared baseline missed, and the result survived tests or later data.
- `no_gain`: it reached the same actionable result without additional verified
  value.
- `refuted`: its distinctive recommendation failed its stated validation test.

The baseline must be named, such as the unchanged policy, a fixed checklist, or
an actually executed lower-context/model review. Never invent another model's
result. Every later review should actively ask what evidence would show that
the current direction is wrong.

## Current decision checkpoint

- Domestic: do not loosen entry thresholds from the 2026-07-28 sample. Blocked
  candidates had materially negative forward returns and the day was an
  unusually adverse KOSPI regime.
- Overseas: do not loosen entry thresholds yet. Recent gross gains were largely
  consumed by estimated round-trip costs, and blocked-signal forward returns
  did not clear that cost hurdle.
- Correct accounting and monitoring defects before judging either policy:
  stale exit replacements are not new realized trades, and virtual US holdings
  retain their recorded exchange.
